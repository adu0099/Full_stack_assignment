    <h1>The Sundarbans</h1>

    <section>
        <p>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta
            of
            the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s
            Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal
            waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example
            of
            ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the
            Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.</p>

        <h3>Outstanding Universal Value </h3>
        <h3>Brief synthesis</h3>
        <p>The Sundarbans Reserve Forest (SRF), located in the south-west of Bangladesh between the river Baleswar in
            the East and the Harinbanga in the West, adjoining to the Bay of Bengal, is the largest contiguous mangrove
            forest in the world. Lying between latitude 21° 27′ 30″ and 22° 30′ 00″ North and longitude 89° 02′ 00″ and
            90° 00′ 00″ East and with a total area of 10,000 km2, 60% of the property lies in Bangladesh and the rest in
            India. The land area, including exposed sandbars, occupies 414,259 ha (70%) with water bodies covering
            187,413 ha (30%).

            The three wildlife sanctuaries in the south cover an area of 139,700 ha and are considered core breeding
            areas for a number of endangered species. Situated in a unique bioclimatic zone within a typical
            geographical situation in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal, it is a landmark of ancient heritage of
            mythological and historical events. Bestowed with magnificent scenic beauty and natural resources, it is
            internationally recognized for its high biodiversity of mangrove flora and fauna both on land and water.

            The immense tidal mangrove forests of Bangladeshs’ Sundarbans Forest Reserve, is in reality a mosaic of
            islands of different shapes and sizes, perennially washed by brackish water shrilling in and around the
            endless and mind-boggling labyrinths of water channels. The site supports exceptional biodiversity in its
            terrestrial, aquatic and marine habitats; ranging from micro to macro flora and fauna. The Sundarbans is of
            universal importance for globally endangered species including the Royal Bengal Tiger, Ganges and Irawadi
            dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and the critically endangered endemic river terrapin (Batagur baska). It is
            the only mangrove habitat in the world for Panthera tigris tigris species.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Criterion (ix):</h3>
        <p>The Sundarbans provides a significant example of on-going ecological processes as it represents the process
            of delta formation and the subsequent colonization of the newly formed deltaic islands and associated
            mangrove communities. These processes include monsoon rains, flooding, delta formation, tidal influence and
            plant colonization. As part of the world’s largest delta, formed from sediments deposited by three great
            rivers; the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna, and covering the Bengal Basin, the land has been moulded by
            tidal action, resulting in a distinctive physiology.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Criterion (x):</h3>
        <p>One of the largest remaining areas of mangroves in the world, the Sundarbans supports an exceptional level of
            biodiversity in both the terrestrial and marine environments, including significant populations of globally
            endangered cat species, such as the Royal Bengal Tiger. Population censuses of Royal Bengal Tigers estimate
            a population of between 400 to 450 individuals, a higher density than any other population of tigers in the
            world.

            The property is the only remaining habitat in the lower Bengal Basin for a wide variety of faunal species.
            Its exceptional biodiversity is expressed in a wide range of flora; 334 plant species belonging to 245
            genera and 75 families, 165 algae and 13 orchid species. It is also rich in fauna with 693 species of
            wildlife which includes; 49 mammals, 59 reptiles, 8 amphibians, 210 white fishes, 24 shrimps, 14 crabs and
            43 mollusks species. The varied and colourful bird-life found along the waterways of the property is one of
            its greatest attractions, including 315 species of waterfowl, raptors and forest birds including nine
            species of kingfisher and the magnificent white-bellied sea eagle.

        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>The Sundarbans is the biggest delta, back water and tidal phenomenon of the region and thus provides diverse
            habitats for several hundreds of aquatic, terrestrial and amphibian species. The property is of sufficient
            size to adequately represent its considerably high floral and faunal diversity with all key values included
            within the boundaries. The site includes the entire landscape of mangrove habitats with an adequate
            surrounding area of aquatic (both marine and freshwater) and terrestrial habitats, and thus all the areas
            essential for the long term conservation of the Sundarbans and its rich and distinct biodiversity

            The World Heritage property is comprised of three wildlife sanctuaries which form the core breeding area of
            a number of species of endangered wildlife. Areas of unique natural beauty, ethno botanical interest,
            special marine faunal interest, rivers, creeks, islands, swamps, estuaries, mud flats, and tidal flats are
            also included in the property. The boundaries of the property protect all major mangrove vegetation types,
            areas of high floral and faunal values and important bird areas. The integrity of the property is further
            enhanced by terrestrial and aquatic buffer zones that surround, but are not part of the inscribed property.

            Natural calamities such as cyclones, have always posed threats on the values of the property and along with
            saline water intrusion and siltation, remain potential threats to the attributes. Cyclones and tidal waves
            cause some damage to the forest along the sea-land interface and have previoulsy caused occasional
            considerable mortality among some species of fauna such as the spotted deer. Over exploitation of both
            timber resources and fauna, illegal hanting and trapping, and agricultural encroachment also pose serious
            threats to the values of the property and its overall integrity.</p>

        <h3>Protection and management requirements</h3>
        <p>The property is composed of three wildlife sanctuaries and has a history of effective national legal
            protection for its land, forest and aquatic environment since the early 19th century. All three wildlife
            sanctuaries were established in 1977 under the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974,
            having first been gazetted as forest reserves in 1878. Along with the Forest Act, 1927, the Bangladesh
            Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act 1974, control activities such as entry, movement, fishing, hunting
            and extraction of forest produces. A number of field stations established within Sundarbans West assist in
            providing facilities for management staff. There are no recognised local rights within the reserved forest
            with entry and collection of forest products subject to permits issued by the Forest Department.

            The property is currently well managed and regularly monitored by established management norms, regular
            staff and individual administrative units. The key objective of management is to manage the property to
            retain the biodiversity, aesthetic values and integrity. A delicate balance is needed to maintain and
            facilitate the ecological process of the property on a sustainable basis. Another key management priority is
            the maintenance of ongoing ecological and hydrological process which could otherwise be threatened by
            ongoing developmental activities outside the property. Subject to a series of successively more
            comprehensive management plans since its declaration as reserved forest, a focus point of many of these
            plans is the management of tigers, together with other widlife, as an integral part of forest management
            that ensures the sustainable harvesting of forest products while maintaining the coastal zone in a way that
            meets the needs of the local human population. The working plans for the Sundarbans demonstrate a
            progressive increase in the understanding of the management requirements and the complexity of prescriptions
            made to meet them.

            Considerable research has been conducted on the Sundarbans wildlife and ecosystem. International input and
            assistance from WWF and the National Zoological Park, the Smithsonian Institution as well as other
            organisations has assisted with the development of working plans for the property, focusing on conservation
            and management of wildlife.

            The Sundarbans provides sustainable livelihoods for millions of people in the vicinity of the site and acts
            as a shelter belt to protect the people from storms, cyclones, tidal surges, sea water seepage and
            intrusion. The area provides livelihood in certain seasons for large numbers of people living in small
            villages surrounding the property, working variously as wood-cutters, fisherman, honey gatherers, leaves and
            grass gatherers.

            Tourism numbers remain relatively low due to the difficult access, arranging transport and a lack of
            facilities including suitable accommodation. Mass tourism and its impacts are unlikely to affect the values
            of the property. While the legal protection afforded the property prohibit a number of activities within the
            boundaries illegal hunting, timber extraction and agricultural encroachment pose potential threats to the
            values of the property. Storms, cyclones and tidal surges up to 7.5 m high, while features of the areas,
            also pose a potential threat with possible increased frequency as a result of climate change.</p>
