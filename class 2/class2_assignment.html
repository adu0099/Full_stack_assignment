                <a href="../class 2/Sundarban.html">The Sundarbans</a>
            </h2>
            <p>The Sundarbans, located in the southwestern part of Bangladesh, is the largest mangrove forest in the
                world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is home to the Royal Bengal Tiger and offers breathtaking
                views of its lush greenery and diverse wildlife.

                Sundarbans (pronounced /sʌnˈdɑːrbənz/) is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of the
                Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers in the Bay of Bengal. Sundarban Reserve Forest (SRF) of Bangladesh
                is the largest mangrove forest in the world. It spans the area from the Baleswar River in Bangladesh's
                division of Khulna to the Hooghly River in India's state of West Bengal. It comprises closed and open
                mangrove forests, land used for agricultural purpose, mudflats and barren land, and is intersected by
                multiple tidal streams and channels. Sundarbans is home to the world's largest area of mangrove
                forests.[3] Four protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz.
                Sundarbans West (Bangladesh), Sundarbans South (Bangladesh), Sundarbans East (Bangladesh) and Sundarbans
                National Park (India).[4]

                Despite the protected status, the Indian Sundarbans were considered endangered in a 2020 assessment
                under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework.[5] The Sundarbans mangrove forest covers an area of
                about 10,000 km2 (3,900 sq mi), of which forests in Bangladesh's Khulna Division extend over 6,517 km2
                (2,516 sq mi) and in West Bengal, they extend over 3,483 km2 (1,345 sq mi) across the South 24 Parganas
                and North 24 Parganas districts.[6] The most abundant tree species are sundri (Heritiera fomes) and gewa
                (Excoecaria agallocha). The forests provide habitat to 453 fauna wildlife, including 290 bird, 120 fish,
                42 mammal, 35 reptile and eight amphibian species.[7] Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of
                wildlife other than fish and some invertebrates, there has been a consistent pattern of depleted
                biodiversity or loss of species in the 20th century, with the ecological quality of the forest
                declining.[8]</p>

            <h2>Cox's Bazar</h2>
            <p>Cox's Bazar is known for having the longest natural sea beach in the world, stretching over 120
                kilometers along the southeastern coastline of Bangladesh. It is a popular destination for beach
                lovers, offering golden sands, clear blue waters, and stunning sunsets.

                Cox's Bazar (/ˌkɒksɪz bəˈzɑː/; Bengali: কক্সবাজার, romanized: Kôksbajar; pronounced [kɔksbadʒaɾ]) is a
                city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in southeastern Bangladesh. The iconic
                Cox's Bazar Beach, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangladesh, is the longest
                uninterrupted natural beach in the world.[1][2] Located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong,
                Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." An old name
                was "Palongkee". Kutupalong refugee camp, the world's largest refugee camp, is in Cox's Bazar.[3][4]

                The city covers an area of 23.4 km2 (9.0 sq mi) with 58 mahallas and 27 wards and as of 2022 had a
                population of nearly 200,000.[5] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.[6][7]

                The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India
                Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work,
                a market was established and named after him. It is one of Bangladesh's main tourist spots. In 2023
                Bangladesh evacuated over 50,000 people to safe shelters as Cyclone Mocha approached.[8]

                History
                During the early 9th century, the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of
                Arakan kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666.[9] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing
                through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its
                scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand
                palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins,"
                still exists in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the
                Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.

                The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer, Captain Hiram
                Cox, who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar) outpost. He succeeded
                Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of Bengal following the British East India Company Act in 1773.
                Cox embarked upon the task of rehabilitation and settlement for the Arakanese refugees in the area.[10]
                He rehabilitated many refugees in the area, but died in 1799 before finishing his work. To commemorate
                him, a market was established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first established
                in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.[9]</p>
